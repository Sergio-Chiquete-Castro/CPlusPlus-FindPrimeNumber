# CPlusPlus-FindPrimeNumber



Defines a function Prime that takes an integer n as input and determines whether n is a prime number or not by counting its factors. It then prints "prime" if n has exactly two factors (1 and itself), indicating it's a prime number, and "not prime" otherwise. Finally, in the main function, it calls Prime with the argument 10, which will output "not prime" since 10 has more than two factors.
